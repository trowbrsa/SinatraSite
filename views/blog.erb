    My fellow Adie, Kelly, made a great spreadsheet of things to do in Seattle on the cheap.
    This entry pulls a couple of things to do from the list of over 50 items she provided to our cohort.
    Check out some of the items below, or refresh the page for some new ideas!

    <h4>Activities for you:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><%= @activities1 %></li>
      <li><%= @activities2 %></li>
      <li><%= @activities3 %></li>

      <h2> On Fonts </h2>
    </header>

      Fonts. We see them everywhere. Some fonts have been scrutinized by their user - a single font can take one
      an hour to select from the plethora of fonts that exist in the world. Other people are happy
      using the default font, letting their creativy energy flow to other design considerations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're in the latter camp, here's an easy guide to make sure you're selecting a font that doesn't have
      a notoriously bad rep for the people in the former camp. Check it out below!

      Please note: Unfortunately I wasn't able to incorporate the 'font' tag into the fonts so you have a visual of the fonts. This will come
      when we learn CSS (very soon!).
