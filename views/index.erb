          Thanks for dropping by. I am a digital strategist living in Seattle, WA. I am currently enrolled in <a href="www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developer's Academy</a>
          where I will be studying web development through September 2016. This is my first Sinatra site! Here, I will document current <a href="/projects">projects</a> as well
          as well as <a href="/blog">random musings</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see,  this here website is still a work in progress. Fortunately, Ada gives me new tools every day to
          build me a badass website and walk away with a rockin' toolbelt. Huzzah!
        </p>
